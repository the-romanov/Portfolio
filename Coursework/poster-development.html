                        My path into creating a poster began with a passion for design.<br><br>
                        As a person who sees advertisements, I was interested with<br><br>how they made their assets.
                        I felt like crafting a poster that<br><br>would be extremely perfect would be a challenge.<br><br>
                        Truth be told, only imagination will get you very far.

                       To give us some sort of substance we can work with, we must first of all have a plan.
                       <br><br>
                       I have made moodboards. These moodboards will be my base for creating mt poster.<br><br>
                       As visible, I have images that relate to first-person shooters. The images seen would make an excellent portrait of first-person games.<br><br>
                       This is because we want to keep the frames simple. We want to denote first person characteristics with a first person game. It only makes sense.<br><br>
                       There is the colour swatch. It is basic. It consists of red, blue, black, & grey. Our colours are plain but reasonable.<br><br>
                       We are trying to captivate the audience by using loud colours. Bright red and bright blue are embedded to give the attraction to the audience.

                        Once I have a concept in mind, I dive into building a concept. This stage is crucial as it focuses on seeing
                        which designs I would like.
                        Elements such as movement, action, or foreshadowing are key to showing life to a poster. The goal is to create a simple print media 
                        product that is captivating and tells the genre of the game I have made: "Capsule The Poly".
                        <br><br>
                        During prototyping, I also focus on colour schemes and aesthetic.
                        The colour scheme is important. I have decided to go with loud colours like red and blue as that
                        would attract the most attention. While these colours are somewhat childish, they all bring an
                        effort to highlight the scene as vibrant.

                        I have already crafted part of the elements as mentioned in the "Game Development" card.<br><br>
                        What I have done is to bring about the game elements and exported the character into .fbx<br><br>
                        I have then manipulated the bones so that the character is holding the rifle looking engaged.

                    Once the poster reaches an adequte state, I conduct tests to gather feedback. I invite others to comment on the poster, 
                    observe their reactions, and analyse how successful the advertisement is. This phase often reveals issues with opinions, 
                    norms, and results.
                    <br><br>
                    I take feedback seriously, as it helps me refine the poster and ensure that it resonates with players. This is where 
                    I adjust the posters. As a result. I have made 2 posters with both the same motto but different layout. We have landscape and portrait.
                    This is because we want to be able to allow for different style of posters to be present. There are also some scenarios where landscape is better than portrait.

                    Poster development is not easy. With careful planning and results checking, you can no doubt get the most desirable result.
                    As we have gotten an extremely desirable result. We have two beautiful posters for which both are effective at potraying the first-person shooter.
                    By portraying the first-person shooter game with first-person shooter characteristics, it reminds the audience that this is a first-person shooter game.
                    There is no need to make some quirky elements that distract people from the poster and its true intention.
