                            With any great project to be made, we need to know the direction. This is where the client brief is introduced.<br><br>
                            The client brief is extremely important as we need to know what to create. Looking at the brief that has been given, I have an idea what to create.<br><br>
                            Instead of using a generic website builder which anyone can do, we are going to program it from scratch, programming it from scratch allows us to achieve our design while also proving our skills.

                            While creating a website is fun, we need to make sure of a few things. Part of those few things is to abide by the law and ethics while also knowing what to create.<br><br>
                            We need to make things like Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions etc. This is not being created for fun. This is being created because we want to establish a clear definition and protect ourselves.<br><br>
                            Outlining ethics, law, and ideas allows us to be considerate in our approach.

                            As with any website, we must plan. Planning is important because we want to know how our website will look like with our best imagination. It is also at best interest to let the client have their own say.<br><br>
                            Allowing us to create the website made flexibility an even greater thing because using a website builder like Webflow or Wix will not make website designing of unique elements possible.

                            Once the website is developed, I conduct thorough testing to ensure everything works as expected. I test across multiple devices and browsers to check for compatibility issues.<br><br> 
                            Performance optimisation is key, this includes minifying CSS and JavaScript and implementing caching strategies to improve loading times.<br><br> 
                            Additionally, I perform usability testing to ensure that the site is easy to navigate and intuitive for users.<br><br>

                    <p class="sectiontext justifymargin">
                        Website development is a comprehensive process that requires attention to detail and technical expertise.<br><br> 
                        Throughout this journey, I've learned how to balance functionality and design, optimise performance, and provide a seamless user experience. I look forward to continuing to build interactive websites that deliver value to users.
