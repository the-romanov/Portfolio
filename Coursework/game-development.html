                        My journey into game development began with a passion for gaming.<br><br>I was not only fascinated by interactive experiences, I always wanted to create interactive experiences. 
                        As a child, I was captivated by games and fascinated how they made it.<br><br>This fascination grew as I started learning programming languages and experimenting with game engines. 
                        Over the years, I have developed a strong foundation in game design, coding, asset creation, and interactive gameplay, which have become the core pillars of my development process 
                        and the ways to bring a game to life.

                        Once I have a concept in mind, I dive into building a concept. This stage is crucial as it focuses on testing the game's 
                        core mechanics without worrying about the final art or design. I use rapid iteration to test different gameplay 
                        elements such as movement, combat, or mechanics. The goal is to create a simple, functional version 
                        of the game that serves as the foundation for further development.
                        <br><br>
                        During prototyping, I also focus on implementing basic controls and interaction systems. It's vital to ensure that 
                        the player’s experience is intuitive and engaging. Whether it’s combat, exploration, or interaction with other players, the 
                        core mechanics need to work smoothly before adding additional layers to the game.

                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start; margin: 2vw;">
                    <p class="sectiontext">
                        Once the core mechanics are established and functional, the next crucial phase in game development is asset creation and integration. 
    This is where the game truly begins to take shape, as assets and code help bring the world to life. The code you see in this section shows how multiple clients will react to a player damage system. As we build a multiplayer game, we must replicate properties.
    <br><br>
    During asset creation, I utilise industry-standard tools like Autodesk 3DS Max for modeling and animation, as well as software for texturing and rigging. Each character or environmental asset is crafted to lead us to the final result. The image with the gun shows how the bones look unconventional. The reason for this is to allow the muzzle fire animation to be led from the muzzle point. We also need to have the top shaft of the gun to move therefore enhancing realism.
    <br><br>
    At this stage, the game’s environment starts to feel fully realised, as players can interact with the visual and audio elements in a fluid and intuitive way. Whether it’s firing a gun, exploring a new environment, or hearing ambient sounds that react to player actions, asset integration forms the backbone of a believable and immersive experience.

                    Step 3: UI/UX Design & Polishing

                <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; width: 100%; margin-top: 2vw;">

                        A well-designed UI is essential for ensuring that players can easily interact with the game. I focus on creating intuitive 
                        menus, HUDs, and interactive elements that are easy to navigate. The goal is to make the UI feel like a natural part of 
                        the game world, not a distracting overlay.
                        <br><br>
                        The UX design is also crucial. It ensures that the user experience is fluid and free of frustrations. I pay close 
                        attention to input responsiveness, intuitive controls, and seamless transitions between game states (e.g., menus, gameplay, etc.).
                        This phase also involves bug fixing and refining mechanics to ensure the game is polished and enjoyable.

                <p class="sectiontext" style="width: 83vw; margin: 2vw;">
                    Once the game reaches a stable state, I conduct extensive playtests to gather feedback. I invite others to play the game, 
                    observe their reactions, and analyze how they interact with the game world. This phase often reveals issues with difficulty, 
                    level design, or even minor bugs that need fixing.
                    <br><br>
                    I take feedback seriously, as it helps me refine the gameplay and ensure that it resonates with players. This is where 
                    I adjust the difficulty curve, fine-tune player interactions, and ensure that the game provides the right balance of challenge 
                    and fun.

                    Game development is an incredibly rewarding journey that requires patience, creativity, and technical expertise. 
                    Throughout the process, I’ve learned the importance of planning, iterating, and embracing feedback. My skills have 
                    grown with each project, and I’m excited to continue pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment.
