The Outline Ideas: 

The Purpose: 

    Create a website to promote our product. This product is within the Star Wars genre. We are making an impression to attract those interested in Sci-Fi. The website will be programmed and interactive to engage the people on the website, and to increase conversions. 

    To bring an experience to our customers, the lore will be explained and how the game is presented. We will make an attractive trailer with high quality images depicting gameplay. We are going to target all ages and gamers. We want to make it adventurous, strategical, and the ability to role-play. We want to create a community. We want to leverage our conversions by having extensions to our main product. 

    Most importantly, to be able to sell our game to anybody through our website.

Legal & Ethical Issues with the project: 

=> PEGI Rating – Games need to be rated by the PEGI standard. This helps ensure consumer knowledge of what is in the game. 

=> Intellectual Property Rights – Making a Sci-Fi genre game similar to Star Wars can have IP (intellectual property) issues. We could be copying their style or characters by accident. We need to make sure that the game is distinguishable as an inspiration or of something similar. 

=> Violence, Blood, Sensitivity – We need to consider the possibility of violence being represented towards real life. As there may be guns and blood involved, we need to consider how we can make settings for such or how we can mitigate the spread of violence in the real world. 

=> Privacy – If we do utilise online services, we need to be transparent of how we collect and process data. 

=> Microtransactions – As we aim to make the game customisable, we may allow asset creators to be able to push out their models in the game for a certain price. Microtransactions may encourage people to spend too much money or get scammed. We need regulations when it comes to asset distribution. 

=> User Generated Content (UGC) - As we will allow User Generated Content to our game, we must account for people potentially infringing copyright or publishing grotesque assets through our services. To combat this, a ruleset will be introduced to combat this.
